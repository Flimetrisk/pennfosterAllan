	ASSIGNMENT 1. THE AMERICAN INDIANS
		Page 11 assignment objectives

		THE FIRST PEOPLE OF THE AMERICAS
			15000 years ago first humans arrived North America. From Asia traveled through a land bridge formed by the combination of lower sea levels and frozen water. 
			These people were hunters rather than agricultors.
			These people where following food sources rather than settle in one place. Nomads.
			Temperature warmed -> food sources became more varied --> allowed people to spread further to the south.
			This spreading process created new societies extendes through North, Central and South America, where deveolped new languagegs and cultures.
			Some scholars (estudios) disagree with the land bridge theory.  -> These scholars theroize people originally came to the North America 40 000 years ago in small boats.

			Approx. 3 500 years ago American Indians in central Mexico developed three important domesticated crops:
				- Maize (corn)
				- Squash
				- Beans
			Agriculture -> population growth -> Mexico nowadays. 
			The agriculture techniques of Mexicans spread to the north. 

			**** Agriculture allows human to produce food on a more reliable basis than hunting/gathering and allows for greater amounts of food to be produced.  -> this allows to growth population.


			Â· EARLY AMERICAN INDIAN CULTURES
				These cultures regions are being discuseed in terms of groups sharing a similar lifestyle rather than sharing the same political organization or leadership. 
				Each one of the regions discussed was made up of many different culture groups who would compete and war with each other if needed. 

			Â· SOUTHWEST CULTURE
				The Southwest culture encompassed much of what's now the southwestern corner of North America. 
				This cultured --> impacted by the dry climate of the area -> developed new technologies. Where made out of locally available resources: sandstone and sun-dried bricks. 

			Â· Mississippi
				Missisippi River Valley culture -> enjoyed a humid and remperate climate. 
				It benefited from easy access to the waters of the mississippi river and waterways that flow into it.
				Easy access to water -> great agriculture and largest sttlements in North America. 

			Â· The GREAT PLAINS CULTURE
				Great plains culture -> between Mississippi River and Rocky Mountains.
				Great Pains culture, include **APACHE** lived a nomadic lifestyle following the great herds of buffalo. 
				While hunt, this nomadic culture lived in "tepees", a kind of shelters made of animal hides.

			Â· EASTERN WOODLANDS CULTURE
				The eastern Woodlands culture centered on the Appalachin Mountain range in the eastern parts of North America. This culture benefited from 3 factors:
					1. A wide range of waterways
					2. Soil that could be framed
					3. A large number of wild animals to hunt
				Note the differences between the north and south Eastern Woodlands groups. 
				The climate in South ---> Allowed longer growing season 
				The climate in North ---> Need to rely more on hunting and gathering techniques. 
				NOTE the Iroquois League, which acted as a peace keeping confederation among the northern Iroquois 
				In this situation --> fears was present, preventing a war among the tribes. 

			COMMON CULTURAL FEATURES
				Geography and climate caused a variety of cultures to develop in North America.
				But, American Indians held some common features:
					- Political power -> spreaded among many local chiefs . They didn't have centralized nations.
					- American Indians owned little private property. Local land was considered common ground for all to  use.
					- Men and women divided  work upon gener lines:
							men -> Hunting  && warfare
							women-> Cared children && wove baskets && prepared and gathered food.

3 THE WEST AFRICANS
  Rich and varied cultures emerged in West Africa. The interaction between EUropean and West African cultures in the 1400s helped set the stage for the transatlantic system of slavery.


  WEST AFRICAN KINGDOMS
       Initially the sailors acted as pirates seizing gold pepper and slaves. But african ressistance soon forced the Portuguese to shift to trade.


       - GEOGRAPHY ENCOURGAGE
       	 West africa is a varied land with valuable natural resources in particular salt and gold.
	 Hundeds of years ago, resources provided a thriving trade netwok. his trade revolved around certain trading towns, which grew into great and powerful empires.


       - Ghana
       	 Between a.d300 and 1500, three kingdoms rose and fell in west africa.
	 The earliest was Ghana, which would expand from the Sahara to the Gulf Of Guinea and from the Atlantic Ocean to the Niger River. 
	 A thriving caravan trade ith african peoples across the Sahara to Morocco resulted in extensive Muslim influence in North Afrrica.
	 The ancient kingdom hhad large towns, beautlifully designed buildings, a system of commerce and a complex political structure.


       - Mali
       	 Attacks from outsiders eventually weaked ghana's control of Weast African trade. Ghana was supplanted around a.d 1200 by a new kingdom known as Mali.
	 Most famous ruler in Mali -> Mansa Musa.
	 Expanded Mali's domain wesward to the Atlantic coast and increased the role of Islam.
	 His promotion of Islamisc scholarship helped lead to the founding of the famous University of Timbuktu.
	 This great center of learning was known throughut the Islamic World. The kingdom of Mali weakend after the death of Mansa Musa in 1332.


       - Songhai
	 By the 1400s Songhai emerged. Under the rules of Askia Muhammad, this empire sustained an Islamic sysyem of education based at Timbuktu.
	 Songhai grew rich thanks to trade. In 1468 Songhai conquered Mali. So, Songhai became the most powerful empire in West Africa.


       - Other kingdoms
         Niger, Guinea, obas, Benin, etc. Who cares?



  WEST AFRICAN lIFE
  Religous belifs and fimaly bonds were among the ways of life that reinforced a sense of community.

       - RELIGOUS BELIFS
       	 Caravans brought Islam across the Sahara to the people of the savanna. Africans held traditional belifs.
	 The people of West Africa belived just as the American Indians, in spirits.The spirist were specially honored.


       - ECONOMY AND SOCIETY
       	 Land belonged to extended networks derived from an ancient ancestor.
	 The kings could readly replace officials ( who who collected tribute from the peasants), reassigning that particular land to a new favourite.
	 The peasants who worked the land couldn't be removed from it, nor could they sell it or rent it to others.
	 Often the people of a village worked the land in common and divided the harvest according to the number of people in each household. Owning slaves or wifes determined the wealth of a person.


  SLAVERY IN AFRICA
  Slavery in Africa was common. In fact, humans were items of trading.

       - AFRICAN RULERS AND ARAB TRADERS
       	 West african sold about 1000 slaves annually to Arab traders. The slave trade was an important part of West Africa's economy.
	 Slavery was a common fate for people who were conquered or captured during warfare. People who committed crimes or were otherwise found undesirable to the community might also be enslaved.
	 Slaved were usually adopted by the families into which they were sold.They could also marry and their children didn't inherit the status of slaves.
	 Slavery wasn't based on the notion of racial superiority or inferiority.



       - THE PORTUGUESE EXPLOIT THE SLAVE TRADE.
       	 Portugueses exported a variety of goods, including peppers, ivor, copper and African slaves.
	 Commercial treaties permitted the Portuguese treated rivals brutally, confiscating their vessels and casting their crews into the ocean to drown.
	 Portuguese didn't invented slaving, but they expanded it greatly. Europeans purchased about 1800 African slaves a year.
	 Most of the slaves worked on sugar plantations located on the Madeira, Canary and Azore islands.
	 Growing numbers went across the Atlantic to new plantations in the Americas. Thus began the brutal exploitation of West Africans enslaved by Europeans.

4 FIRST ENCOUNTERS
With financial backing from Spain, Christobal Columbusfound teh Americas, and he conquered it, exploited it and its wealth.

     SPAIN LOOKS TO THE WEST
     In 1487 portuguese Bartolomeu Dias learned how to use the counterclockwise winds of the South Atlantic to get arouund Africa.
     In 1498 Vasci da Gama exploited that discovery to reach India opening an immensely profitable trade route.
     By leaping from one set of Islands to another, mariners could one day reach the covated coast of China.
     By 15th century Europeans didn't think that teh world was flat.


     THE VOYAGES OF CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS.
     He sought a route to China as means of reviving the Christian struggle against Islam. He hoped to recruit chinese people and use their wealth to assist Europeans in a new crusade.
     Columbus dared the westward trip because he understimated the size of Earth.


     	      - COLUMBUS INVESTIGATES VIKING STORIES.
	      	 he probably heard about the weastern discoveries by the Vikings from scandinavia.


	      - COLUMBUS SETS SAIL
	      	In 1492 Queen Isabella and King Ferninand of Spain provided 3 ships, 90 men and the most of the funding for Columbuss's voyage west in search of China.
		After 33 days at sea, he reached what we now call the Bahamas. Turning south Columbus found another set of islands. He suppoused that thtese belonged to the East Indies.
		The presence of native people didn't stop Columbus from claiming the land for Spain.


	      - REACTIONS TO COLUMBUS'S VOYAGE
	      	he establshed a  settlement on the istalnd he called Hispaniola.
		Then in early 1493 leaving a number of his crew behind, he retruned tot Spain.
		Later that year, columbus returned to the Caribean to colonize Hispaniola.
		The new colony was suppoused to produce profits by shipping gold, sugar and Indian slaves to Spain. The spanishplanned to dominate the natives and forge an empire based in Europe.
		After his return to Hispaniola, natives had killed the colonists he had left behind.
		Emplying the military advantages m Columbus returned to SPain and died in 1506.
		The spanish colonization of the Americas continued.
		Columbus hadn't reached Asia, but he had found a source of riches that enabled European Christendom to grow more powerful and wealthy than the Muslim world.
		During the next three centuries, the mineral and plantation wealth of the Americas helped finance the expansion of European commerce.
		They created new technology and new weapons.



	      - SPAIN N' PORTUGAL DIVIDE THE AMERICAS
	      	Spanish and the Portuguese negotiated the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas. Theu agreed to split the world of new discoveries by drawing a north.south boundary line through the mid-Atlantic west of the Azores.
		Portugues -> scured a monopoly to exploit the coast of Africa and teh Indian Ocean.
		Spanish -> Reclaimed Columbus's western lands.
		** Brazil in the Portuguese sphere.
		In dividing the worl no one bothered to consult the Native Americans.
		The other European kings refused to honor the treaty for they claimed an equal right to explore and exploit the new lands.


     THE SPANISH EXPAND THEIR AMERICAN EMPIRE.
     In 1497 John Cabor, a Genose mariner sailed to Newfoundland. In tropicalñ waters, a portuguese fleet commanded by Pedro Alvarez Cabral discovered the coast of Brazil in 1500.
     A year later, Amerigo Vespucci explored enough South America's coast to deem it a new continent. European mapmakers began to call the new continent by a variant og Vespucci's name (America).
     By 1519 a Ferninand Magellan voyage succeed in encircling the inter globe globe, fillin' in even more of the increasingly picture of Earth.


     - CORTÉS CONQUERS THE AZTECS
       Conquistadors -> soldiers who explored cental Mexico and defeated Indian civilizations.
       1519 Hernan Cortés led a gorup of about 600 volunteers from Cuba to the coast of Mexico.
       By 1504 tried hi luck in Cuba where he became rich by acquaring plantations and gold mines. But he hungered for more.
       The approach of Cortés army alarmed the Aztec ruler, Moctezuma.
       Moctezuma invited the Spanish into his great city.
       Tenochtitlán had a population of 200.000 people ( to make a comparision, Europe had 70.000).
       Stone pyramid-templates dazzled with a combination of red. blue and ochre stucco.
       The city's gold and silver inflamed the Spanish desire to conquer and plunder. By seizing and killing Moctezuma, the Spanish provoked violent street fighting that initially drove them from the city.
       Cortés capture Tenochtitlan. Four months of fighting had reduced the city to a bloody rubble.
       The victors put thousand of captive Indians to work raising a Spanish capital, Mexico City on the cuins of Technotitlán.
       The slaves reworked stones from gret pyramids into a Christian cathedral.
