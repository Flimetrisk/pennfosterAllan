**************************************************
	THE AMERICAN INDIANS
	FIRST PEOPLE OF THE AMERICAS
	First humans to live in the America are known as Paleoamericans
	
		PEOPLE MIGRATE TO THE AMERICAS: First Americans were hunters who arrived 15.000 years ago. Then, the earth was through an Ice age.
		       	       	      		Sea level fell as much as 360 feet below today's level.
						Scholars belive Paleo-Indian hunters crossed this land bridge in pursuit of their favored prey. ( mammoth,
					        mastodons, giant bisons).
						There are theroies  that the first Americans migrated from Asia at least 40.000 years ago. 


		PALEO-INDIANS ADAPT TO CLIMATE CHANGE: Scholars says the abot 12.000 ago the climate warmed. Warmed climate + spread of skilled
		      	       	       	       Paleo-Indian hunters killed off the mammoth and other mammals.
					       Paleo-indian adapted by relying less on hunting large mammals and more on fishing and on gathering nuts, berries and roots.
	  				       Also developed tracking techniques. New food sources led to population growth.
					
		DIVERSE CULTURES EMERGE: Indians became culturally diverse as they adapted to their varying climates and envirnments.
				 	 At least 375 distinct languages were spoken by indians.
					 Each language group divided into many ethnic groups called "Tribes"
					 These Tribes divided into smaller groups that identified with a particular village or hunting territories. 
					 Each group was headed by a chief who was usually advised by a council of elders.
			

		THE BEGINNING OF AGRICULTURE: 3500 years ago in cental Mexico, American Indians developend three important crops: 
		    	      	 	      	  - Maize
						  - squashes
 						  - beans			 
				      	      Some villages grew into great cities ruled by powerful chiefs. 
				     	      By carefully study the sun the moon and stars, the mexican people developed precise claendars of these seasons
				    	      and the days.
					      Gulf of Mexico --> Olmecs - Mayas - Aztecs (most powerful)
				      	      A.D 1200 Crop cultivation was common in the American Southwest, Midweast, Southeast and parts of Northeast.
				      	      In some places people clung to a traditional mix of hunting, gathering and fishing.
				      	      Coastal people in what is now California and the pacific Northwest didn't need to farm
				      	      because their fishing and their gathering was so productive.




	EARLY AMERICAN INDIAN CULTURES
	      	       THE SOUTHWEST: First farming villages emerged in the arid Southwest.
		       Crops required building ponds dams and ditches in order to irrigate or bring water to the fields.
		       The Hohokams --> built more than 500 miles of irration canals. 1k people in a village. Lived in Gila and Salt rivers valley ( Arizona nowadays )
		       In their village, about 1000 people inhabitated row houses build of adobe, a type of sun-dried brick.
		       The Anasazis --> Village required 30K of tons of sand-stone block. Lived in the Four Corners. Pueblos -> Multi-story dwelling with 600 rooms.
		       
		       Between A.D. 1100 and 1300 drought reduced crops. Resulting famine led to violence. Most of the Anasazis moved to the south and east in search of water.


	The MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY: Here enjoys of a humid and temperate clima. The Mississippi collects the waters of wide-ranging tributaries, including the Ohio, Missouri...
	    		      	      The lasgest and wealthiest city of the Mississippi was Cahokia. 
				      Cahokia benefited from being located near rivers, this site provided fertile soil and excellent trade connections. 
				      At peak in the year 1100 Cahokia has a population of at least 10.000 people and not more than 40.000
				      Evidence suggests that an environment crisis led to social conflict. The growing population had deplet the soil and deer.
				      Cahokia dissapeared.


	THE GREAT PLAINS: The Great Plains recieved only between 12 and 20 inches of rain a year. Drought-resistant grasses cover the land.
	    	  	  Graing animals, specially bison or buffalo, were abundant there.
			  During 9th Century some Mississippians moved onto the Great Plains. In the hotter southern valleys, people lived in well-ventilated beehive-shaped 
			  made from wooden frames covered with rass thatch. 
			  Great Plains villages sometimes clashed with nomads who came from the Rocky Mountains to the west.
			  Some nomads established economic ties with the villagers of the valley. But then villagers refused to make business, and nomads, angried, attacked those
			  

	EASTER WOODLANS: Many strems rivers and lakes drained this wooded land. 
	       		 Because of the long growing season, southeasterns groups were primarily farmers, but they also depended on hunting and fishing.
			 Their main crops were :  Corn,  Beans,  Squashes,  Pumpkins.
			 Northeastern developed into two major languages groups: 
			 	      - Algonoquians
				      - Iroquoians
			 Algonquians lived in wigwams ( oval frames between 10-16 feets diameter)
			 Iroquoians built larger multifamily longhouses, some more than 200 feet in lenght.
			 
			 5 Iroquoians peoples united to form a loose confederations -> IROQUOIS LEAGUE. Lacking of central authority, mainly a ritual forum for promoting peaceful
			 The Iroquoins League's guiding law -> constitution, oral tradition.

QUESTION:
	Analyze information: 
	
	Why do you think more technologically advanced cultures would develop among farming societies rather than among hunting and gathering societies?
	    Because, with farming, although hunting and gathering could supply all the persons for a short-term, farming would allow people to establish a long-term 
	    civilization, and they were looking for comfort, otherwise, they wouldn't have. 
	    With hunting and gathering, the life was quite difficult. Maybe could be long seasons where the food wasn't enough for anyone, and then, would be a lot of deaths.
	    With farming, the villages could settle in a place, and start growing rather than having a quite good seasons and quite bad seasons.
